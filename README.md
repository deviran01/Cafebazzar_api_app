My Android Studio got into trouble with the gitlab.com site. That's why the project was first transferred to github.com and entered the gitlab.com site.
I apologize for this and delete my comments.


However, the project was established with the site foursquare.com and the information was received and displayed correctly.

What the software does:

###- [x] 1- Get access permissions from the user on Android versions 23 and above while running the software and locating the user in the Android services section by the Internet provider and the provider of the GPS.

###2. Comparison of the current location with the previous location (if the distance between these two coordinates is less than 100 meters, use of the previous data is stored and otherwise receive new data from the server)

###3. Receive and process data from the server behind the background and slow down the software

###4. Prepare the initial list of the names of nearby places with acceptable graphics

###5-Show more items by clicking on each one

###6. Displays them if they are not connected to the Internet if the previous data is available.

###7 - And more ...


##important points :

###No libraries have been used in this project
>-~~Volley~~
>-~~GSON~~
>-~~RecyclerView~~
>-~~Retrofit~~
>-~~okhttp~~
>-~~RxJava~~
>-~~InifiniteRecyclerView~~
....


There is a possibility of bug occurrence in the software.
Lack of time to improve the user interface

##Problems and Cases:

###1. Not using any library
###2-Limit on the number of requests to foursquare.com
###3.Troubleshoot Android Studio and fix it in the future
